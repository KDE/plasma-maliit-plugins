======

CHANGES SINCE 0.92.2
* Add configure option to disable preedit
  - In this mode, all text is committed immediately. Works around
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=680097 and can be used as a
    "fix" for the corresponding MALIIT#173.
  - Use qmake CONFIG+=disable-preedit, which is automatically set if neither
    CONFIG+=enable-hunspell nor CONFIG+=enable-presage is used.

0.92.2
======

CHANGES SINCE 0.92.1
* Implemented spell checking with Hunspell:
  - Requires Hunspell's development files. Use qmake CONFIG+=enable-hunspell
    to enable this feature.
  - Used best together with presage.
* Expose keyboard style as a plugin setting:
  - Add MALIIT_DEFAULT_PROFILE option to specify default keyboard style.
* New Gnome3 style:
  - Use qmake MALIIT_DEFAULT_PROFILE=gnome3 to activate.

  - Use qmake MALIIT_DEFAULT_PROFILE=olpc-xo to activate.
* Improved magnifier key styling:
  - Can specify separate background graphics: "background\magnifier-key",
    "background\magnifier-key-borders".
  - Can specify magnifier size:
    "${style}\[landscape|portrait]\magnifier-key-[width|height]".
  - Can move text inside magnifier key:
    "${style}\[landscape|portrait]\magnifier-key-label-offset".
  - Use "${style}\[landscape|portrait]\vertical-offset" to position both,
    magnifier key and extended keys. Also moved the style attribute from
    extended-keys.ini to main.ini.

0.92.1
======

CHANGES SINCE 0.92.0
* Added simple sound feedback
  - Requires QtMobility. Use qmake CONFIG+=enable-qt-mobility to enable sound
    feedback.
* Make style self-contained:
  - Each styling profile has its own directory structure,
    maliit-keyboard/data/styles/README for more.
* Better styling support
  - Magnifier, word candidates and extended keys gained more styling
    attributes. Please check
    maliit-keyboard/data/styles/nokia-n9/[main,extended_keys].ini for details.

* Use 0.80 plugins (quick) interface

BUG FIXES
* Fixes: Send correct input method area for MeeGo Keyboard Quick

0.6.5
=====

* New CSS attributes for MImAbstractkeyAreaStyle:
  - auto-padding: If true, center-aligns keys in keyboard area. Depends on
    width of key area's size.

* New features:
  - Extended keys can spread over multiple lines. In the layout files, for
    example:

      <key>
        <binding label="e" extended_labels="èé&#10;ëê€"/>
      </key>

    This will create a 3x2 box holding five labels. &#10; is the XML entity
    representing \n (newline).

0.6.2
=====

* New features:
  - A QML-based keyboard. Does not depend on libmeegotouch. Installs as a
    regular plugin by default, next to the MeeGo Keyboard. Activation like so:
    $ gconftool-2 -s /meegotouch/inputmethods/plugins/onscreen -t string "MeegoKeyboardQuick"

0.6.0
=====

* New features:
  - Virtual keyboard magnifier shows the currently touched letter.
  - Extended keys popup on long-press, for keys with the extended_labels
    attribute in the layout files.

0.5.38
======

* New CSS attributes for MImAbstractKeyAreaStyle:
  - enable-overlay-mode: In overlay mode, reactive area of first/last row
    spawns to top/bottom of display. Does not effect key geometry.

0.5.36
======

* Spacer elements are no longer inactive. Instead, they count as reactive area
  for neighbouring keys.

0.5.20
======

* Internal changes in meego-keyboard:
  - MImKey:
    - New geometry API (MImKey::Geometry) - a key's bounding rect is now
      defined by the key's margins. Geometry can be accessed or modifed through
      ::geometry(), ::setGeometry(.), although there some convenience functions
      for key position, key width and key height. Key position refers to the 
      top left corner of the bounding rect.

  - MImKeyArea:
    - Changed key layouting. Instead of spacing between keys, the layout is now
      fully determined by key size and key margins. That is, spacing between
      two keys only depends on their pairing margins.

  - MImAbstractKeyArea:
    - Changes between different style modes (key13 and key30-key45), depending
      on how many keys a layout has. This gives tighter control over layouts.
      The old behaviour can be activated through
      "sync-style-mode-with-key-count: false;"

  - MImAbstractKeyAreaStyle:
    - Renamed row-height* to key-height*, because that's closer to reality.
    - key-height (row-height) was removed, just use key-height-medium instead.
    - padding behaviour changed:
      - padding-left overrides key-margin-left of the left-most key in a row,
      - padding-top overrides key-margin-top of all keys in top row,
      - padding-right overrides key-margin-right of the right-most key in a
        row,
      - padding-bottom overrides key-margin-bottom of all keys in bottom row.
    - size allows to override height from key area height computation, if > -1.
      Overriding width is not supported yet.
       
0.5.15
========

* Changes in meego-keyboard:
    - changed signature of following signals in MImAbstractKeyArea:
        - keyPressed
        - keyReleased
        - keyClicked
        - longKeyPressed

0.5.11
========

* Changes in meego-keyboard:
    - changed signature of following signals in MImAbstractKeyArea:
        - keyPressed
        - keyReleased
        - keyClicked

========

* Internal changes in meego-keyboard:
  - MImAbstractKey:
    - renamed key() => model()
    - added resetActiveKeys(): will release all stuck keys
    - added visitActiveKeys(.): takes a functor, and applies it to all active
      keys. Aborts iteration if functor returns true.
    - added MImAbstractKeyVisitor interface
    - added lastActiveKey(): returns most recently pressed key that wasn't
      released yet.

  - MImAbstractKeyArea:
    - renamed updateButtonGeometriesForWith() => updateKeyGeometries()

0.5.9-1
=======

* Speed typing improvements

* Internal changes in meego-keyboard:
  - The following classes were renamed:
    - KeyButtonArea          => MImAbstractKeyArea
    - KeyButtonAreaStyle     => MImAbstractkeyAreaStyle
    - SingleWidgetButtonArea => MImKeyArea
    - IKeyButton             => MImAbstractKey
    - SingleWidgetButton     => MImKey
    - VKBDataKey             => MImKeyModel
    - KeyBinding             => MImKeyBinding
  - Cleaned up PopupBase API. It now takes a KeyButtonArea parameter, which
    enables easier communication between popup and the currently active
    KeyButtonArea; the interface consists of:
    - updatePos, cancel, handleKeyPressedOnMainArea,
      handleLongKeyPressedOnMainArea, isVisible, setEnabled
  - SingleWidgetButtonArea headers are now exported.

* New CSS attributes for KeyButtonAreaStyle:
  - debugging-related:
    - draw-button-bounding-rects: [false|true];
    - draw-button-rects: [false|true];
    - debug-touchpoints: [false|true];
    - draw-reactive-areas: [false|true];
  - others:
    - button-bounding-rect-top-adjustment: [int];
    - button-bounding-rect-bottom-adjustment: [int];
    - idle-vkb-timeout: [int in ms];

0.5.?-?
=======

* New CSS properties:
  - touchpoint-horizontal-gravity, touchpoint-vertical-gravity: Allows to
    control how far a finger can slip from the currently touched key button,
    without releasing it. Distance is measured from button border.

    x-large, xx-large. The height can be used to specify the relative row
    height in CSS files (no support for fixed height yet).
  - New fixed attribute for row elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the row height specified in height attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New width attribute for key elements: small, medium (default), large,
    x-large, xx-large, stretched. The new width type can be used to specify
    relative button width in CSS files (no support for fixed width yet).
  - New fixed attribute for key elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the button width specified in size attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New spacer element for row elements: Spacers distribute all remaining space
    of a row among them, after the possible stretcher button has been dealt
    with.
  - The section's alignment attributes have been superseded by spacer elements,
    and therefore, been removed.
  - New action switch for binding: switch action indicates to switch active symbol
    page to the next avaliable page.
