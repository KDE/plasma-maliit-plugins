* New keyboard layouts:
  - Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak, Ukrainian, Turkish, Indonesian, Malay,
    Brazilan, Mexican

* API changes in meego-keyboard:
  - New typedef for QSharedPointer<LayoutSection> -
    LayoutData::SharedLayoutSection.
  - Switch to floating points for SWBA geometry computation.

  - KeyButtonArea:
    - updateButtonGeometries was replaced by updateButtonGeometriesForWidth,
    - buttonInformation, buttonSizeByColumn got removed.

  - LayoutSection:
    - maxNormalizedWidth returns the row width in logical units, using a key's
      width attribute.
    - rowHeight returns the row height, using a row's height attribute.
    - spacerIndices returns a list with the position of space elements for a
      given row.
    - Renamed getVKBKey to vkbKey.

  - LayoutData:
    - Changed return type of section (and its overload) to SharedLayoutSection,
      removing the constness from the contained LayoutSection.

  - LayoutsManager:
    - createInstance, ctor now take an (optional)
      MVirtualKeyboardStyleContainer parameter.
    - Layout returns an empty LayoutData instance in case the queried layout
      could not be found.

  - KeyboardData:
    - Ctor now takes an (optional) MVirtualKeyboardStyleContainer parameter.

  - VKBDataKey:
    - Ctor now takes a StyleType and a SizeType parameter, too.
    - New getters (style, size, isFixedSize) for current StyleType, SizeType
      and whether to use fixed key width or (relative) scaling.
    - normalizedSize returns the key's QSizeF (queried from style and dependend
      on the SizeType).

  - SingleWidgetButtonArea, KeyButtonArea:
    - Removed updateButtonGeometries and made updateButtonGeometriesForWidth a
      pure virtual instead.
    - Removed ButtonSizeScheme, ButtonSize takes over (difference: scheme
      was bound to a whole layout section, size type are flexible).
    - drawSymKeyBackground removed, drawNormalKeyBackground renamed to
      drawKeyBackground: styling (per button) can now be done via style.

    - FlickupButton is removed.

  - FlickupButtonView:
    - FlickupButtonView is removed.

  - FlickUpButtonStyle:
    - FlickUpButtonStyle and FlickUpButtonStyleContainer are removed.

* Keyboard layout files became more expressive:
  - New style attribute for key elements: normal (default), deadkey, special.
    The new style types can be referenced from CSS files, allowing for more
    flexible button styling.
  - New height attribute for row elements: small, medium (default), large,
    x-large, xx-large. The height can be used to specify the relative row
    height in CSS files (no support for fixed height yet).
  - New fixed attribute for row elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the row height specified in height attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New width attribute for key elements: small, medium (default), large,
    x-large, xx-large, stretched. The new width type can be used to specify
    relative button width in CSS files (no support for fixed width yet).
  - New fixed attribute for key elements: true, false (default). It defines
    whether the button width specified in size attributes should be a relative
    or fixed value.
  - New spacer element for row elements: Spacers distribute all remaining space
    of a row among them, after the possible stretcher button has been dealt
    with.
  - The section's alignment attributes have been superseded by spacer elements,
    and therefore, been removed.
  - New action switch for binding: switch action indicates to switch active symbol
    page to the next avaliable page.
